# New Maintainers and Repository Location

wkh237's last Github activity was in September 2017, and he has not reacted to emails either. This repository no longer is the main location of "react-native-fetch-blob".

The owners of this fork have agreed to maintain this package:

https://github.com/joltup/react-native-fetch-blob

That means issues and PRs should be posted there.
